## Features

- **Developmental Stages**: Simulates progression from infant to mature cognitive abilities
- **Neural Networks**: Specialized networks for consciousness, emotions, perception, and thoughts
- **Mother LLM**: AI caregiver that provides nurturing responses and guides development
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of the mind's development
- **Dynamic Growth**: Neural networks that grow and adapt based on experiences

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
